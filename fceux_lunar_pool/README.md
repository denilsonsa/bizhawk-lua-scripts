This directory contains Lua scripts for FCEUX emulator. These scripts were used to take screenshots of all levels of *Lunar Pool* game. They also required the `lua-gd` module.

These scripts can be rewritten for BizHawk (and won't require `lua-gd` anymore). Maybe someday I'll rewrite them. Maybe not.
